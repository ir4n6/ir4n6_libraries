# ir4n6_libraries

Some basic helper libraries that right now are written mostly from my usage standpoint to help with some common modules that I utilize.

## ir4n6_mongodb.py
Primary purpose for this is to make connecting to a MongoDB with authentication enabled.

## ir4n6_neo4j.py
The Neo4j Graph Database is very useful for finding relationships between objects. However, the Neo4j Python module requires a lot of basic coding and can be a challenge to call from a python script.

## ir4n6_Unshorten.py
Find the destination of shortened link so that my IP does not show on the shortening site as having gone to the shortened site.
